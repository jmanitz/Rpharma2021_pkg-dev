# Workshop at R/Pharma 2021 "Building Tidy R Packages"

author: "Leigh Alexander | Juliane Manitz"

date: "R/Pharma workshop | October 27, 2021"

# Workshop Description

**Why make an R package?** So many reasons! From sharing code and collaboration, to reproducibility and regulatory concerns, and finally for organizing you own analysis projects and tidy coding practices, R packages are here to help!

In this workshop, we will cover the very first steps of R package creation, the basic R package structure as well as all relevant components. 

-	Start to write R functions, 
-	document them with help pages, 
-	integrate examples and data, 
-	make sure that your code does what is expected by implementing unit testing, and 
-	finally built it and put it on CRAN or wherever you want to share it. 

We conclude the workshop with a selection of advanced topics related to R packages (e.g., package validation, objected-oriented programming/S3 methods or advanced package documentation with `pkgdown`). 

**Requirements:** This workshop requires some experience with R and is targeted at beginner to intermediate R users
